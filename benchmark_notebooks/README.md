## Active Learning Benchmarking using DISTIL
We include a thorough benchmarking of various AL algorithms that covers many evaluation facets. Our experiments can be found in the benchmark_notebooks folder. To execute these experiments, upload a selected experiment to Google Colab and connect to a hosted runtime. We present the results of this benchmark in each subfolder. More details can be found in [Effective Evaluation of Deep Active Learning on Image Classification Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15324).
